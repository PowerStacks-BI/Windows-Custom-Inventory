# Windows Custom Inventory for Azure Log Analytics

This PowerShell script collects detailed hardware and software inventory from Windows devices and sends the data to an Azure Log Analytics workspace. It was designed for use by **PowerStacks BI for Intune** customers to extend inventory visibility beyond what Intune natively provides.

## Overview

The script provides granular control over the type of inventory collected, including device details, installed applications, drivers, warranty information, and Microsoft 365 metadata. It supports modular configuration, compression, and safe ingestion into Log Analytics under size constraints.

For implementation guidance and integration with the BI for Intune reporting solution, refer to the documentation below.

- Microsoft 365 versioning, channel, and update insights
- Driver inventory from both PnP and optional updates
- Warranty information lookup (Dell, Lenovo, Getac)
- Compressed and Base64-encoded payloads for Azure ingestion
- Compatible with Intune (SYSTEM context), GPO, or Task Scheduler

## Parameters

| Parameter                 | Description                                                                 |

| `SharedKey`               | Primary Key for the workspace                                               |
| `CollectDeviceInventory`  | Enable or disable device inventory collection (default: `$true`)           |
| `CollectAppInventory`     | Enable or disable application inventory (default: `$true`)                 |
| `CollectDriverInventory`  | Enable or disable driver inventory (default: `$true`)                      |
| `RemoveBuiltInMonitors`   | Exclude internal monitors from results (default: `$false`)                 |
| `InventoryDateFormat`     | Timestamp formatting for final status output (default: `"MM-dd HH:mm"`)    |

## Usage

```powershell
.\InventoryCollector.ps1 -CustomerId "<YourWorkspaceID>" -SharedKey "<YourPrimaryKey>"
```

### Optional Vendor Configuration

For warranty collection, set the appropriate vendor credentials in the script:

```powershell
$WarrantyDellClientID = "<your Dell API client ID>"
$WarrantyDellClientSecret = "<your Dell API secret>"
$WarrantyLenovoClientID = "<your Lenovo API key>"
```

## Output

Data is posted to custom tables in Log Analytics:

- `PowerStacksDeviceInventory`
- `PowerStacksAppInventory`
- `PowerStacksDriverInventory`

Payloads are compressed, encoded, and split into safe chunks to meet Azure ingestion limits.

## Requirements

- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- Azure Log Analytics Workspace
- API access for vendor warranty data (optional)
- Execution context with network access (SYSTEM context in Intune is supported)
